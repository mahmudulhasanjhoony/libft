# libft
Part 1 - Libc functions
  
  In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.

Part 2 - Additional functions
  
  In this second part, you must code a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different 
form. Some of these functions can be useful to write Part 1’s functions.
